Hello!

    My name is Mayank Arora. I'm originally from the Bay Area. I am a first-year student in the Computer Science Major at CSUF. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
 
* Lab 2, Part 1

    This lab was one of my favorites for a few reasons. This was due to a couple of factors, firstly, this was the first actual lab we did ourselves, and we did something meaningful, which was exciting because we got to learn new things, and it was only up from there. Additionally, this was one of my favorite labs because we learned the full functions of std::cout and std::cin. Lab 2 only had part one so it was easy to pick this as my favorite part, and did not have to think about picking a different part.

* Lab 6, Part 1

    This Lab was one of the most fun labs I worked on. This was due to me being excited to learn about Bool variables through black jack. We worked on quite a lot in this lab, we learned how to make bool functions and how to do mathematical problems using code which was pretty interesting. We also learned how to do a lot of things that we can use on our personal projects so that was pretty interesting to me. 

* Lab 10, Part 1

    This Lab was another one of my favorites due to its content. I really enjoy learning geographical facts, and this Lab deals with county populations. I also liked it because it showed us how to come up with search queries and how to find a specific thing in a list. Additionally, I really enjoyed it because of my partners, who were always ready to help out.
